# Lyrics_Scraper

This program asks for an artist or band name and, if it can find it on 'letras.mus.br',
it will create a directory with the artist name and inside it will create 'txt' files of the 
top 20 songs of that artist, each named by the song and contaning its lyrics.

To use it, run the 'main.txt' file
